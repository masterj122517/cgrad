So, it's really all about focus and try hard, let's go.

I'm going to apply my working theory on this, whis would be my weekend project

(i need to really practice my C skills)

Static in function: 让变量生存周期变长

Static in .c file (not in function): 让变量或函数只属于当前.c file 

Static in .h file: 让每个用了static的东西被别人使用是都创建一个私有version

inline 的作用是建议编译器“把函数展开到调用点，而不是生成一个真正的函数调用”
